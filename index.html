<h1>iOS Games Worth Playing</h1>
<h3>Last updated on <strong>January 18, 2014</strong>.</h3>
<hr>
  <p>Every so often, a friend asks me for iOS game recommendations. I scramble around to see what I currently have installed on my phone, invariably missing one of my favorites. I recently had this happen twice in one week, so I decided to come up with a better solution.</p>

  <p>I thus give you my definitive list of iOS games that are worth playing.</p>

  <h3 class='rules'>A few ground rules:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>I've aggressively pruned this list. If a game is on here, it's because I really liked it. Like, <em>really</em> liked it.</li>

    <li>This is subjective. If you're outraged your favorite game isn't included here, <a href="mailto:iosgames@lazerwalker.com">email</a> me or <a href="https://twitter.com/lazerwalker">tweet</a> at me. It's very possible I haven't played it and would love to hear about it!</li>

    <li>Although there are a lot of great iOS games that have been ported from other platforms, I'm not including ports unless I feel the iOS version is truly the definitive version.</li>

    <li>A few are singled out as being for the iPad. Some of these are in fact iPad-only; others are technically universal, but I think you'd be silly to play them on a phone.</li>

    <li>Some of these games cost money. Each game on this list will provide many hours of entertainment, usually for less than a cup of coffee. Most are self-published by small, independent studios. Don't be a cheapskate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Single-Player Games</h2>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/868-hack/id635749911?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">868-HACK</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/868-hack/id635749911?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a1763.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/bb/8f/b8/bb8fb888-3426-34f7-f0fe-07ccafa66613/mzl.twplhqtl.png"/></a>
    <p>868-HACK is a "roguelike", meaning it's an RPG with randomly-generated levels, a brutal level of difficulty, and perma-death. Saying that it's unapproachable and difficult to learn is an understatement.</p>

    <p>It's worth it, though. 868-HACK is one of the most elegant games ever designed; every single move you take makes the difference between winning and losing, so the stakes are always sky-high. There's a good reason that many well-respected game designers considered 868-HACK their favorite game of 2013.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackbar/id672002602">Blackbar</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackbar/id672002602"><img class='icon' src="http://a1557.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/81/bc/f3/81bcf36f-4021-99ed-e65a-e9fa5e198a98/mzl.ikqexhro.png"/></a>
    <p>Set in a vague dystopian future, Blackbar tells the story of a resistance movement fighting back against censorship. The story itself is told entirely through written letters which have themselves been censored; the game is figuring out what the censored words are in each correspondance. </p>

    <p>Blackbar strikes the perfect balance between narrative and gameplay, with neither ever feeling too overbearing. It's short, sweet, and has just the right amount of political commentary.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dungeon-raid/id403090531">Dungeon Raid</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dungeon-raid/id403090531"><img class='icon' src="http://a244.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/e4/54/31/mzl.ubyhpedm.png"/></a>
    <p>Dungeon Raid was one of the earliest examples of the iOS gaming trend of taking an established genre and layering on roguelike mechanics. In this match-3 puzzle game, each individual move affects your character. Besides being a great puzzle game, it has everything you'd expect from an RPG: boss fights, a great magic system that encourages strategizing, and a flexible class system.</p>

    <p>Dungeon Raid is perhaps the single most addictive iOS game I've ever played. The linked app is the free version, but you're going to want to buy the full game.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corrypt/id588935336?mt=8&uo=4">Corrypt</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corrypt/id588935336?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://a346.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/04/57/0e/04570e13-f1aa-35c0-b694-ce0671bd0e3e/mzl.pcdcjlnh.png"/></a>
    <p>Corrypt is very possibly my single favorite game of all time on any platform. It starts out as a Sokoban-style block puzzle game, but things take a turn and get weird as the rules of the game itself start to collapse.</p>

    <p>You will have moments where you're convinced you've broken the game and need to restart it to get out of an unwinnable state (hint: you're wrong). You will have "oh shit" moments where a light bulb just clicks and you're suddenly solving puzzles on a higher plane of thought. By the time the game is finished, you'll have had an incredibly personal and moving experience.</p>

    <p>If you only play one game on this entire list, play Corrypt. Seriously.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hoplite/id782438457?mt=8&uo=4">Hoplite</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hoplite/id782438457?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://a213.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/2a/f2/c4/2af2c42b-c870-46bc-c3e6-a544cdf34b76/mzl.daxifsbm.png"/></a>
    <p>Yet another game that mashes up roguelike mechanics with a pre-existing genre. Specifically, it's a hex-based turn-based strategy games. Hoplite is chess-like in the way that multiple simple movement patterns elegantly combine to form higher-level strategies. A truly fantastic game for strategy fans.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hundreds/id493536432?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Hundreds</a> (iPad)</h3>

    <p>With its hip aesthetic, Hundreds feels like the sort of game you'd want to be seen playing in a trendy club. That aside, it's one of the best puzzle games on a platform that has no shortage of puzzles. Although a lot of the game boils down to being able to move your fingers nibly enough, there's no time crunch; you can deliberate as long as you want.</p>

    <p>Hundreds also works really well as a collaborative multiplayer game — get some friends and gather around your iPad!</p>

    <p>In this civilization sim, you're in charge of a primitive tribe in a fantasy world; your goal is to lead your people to prosperity by carefully navigating the various conflicts that inevitably arise. Calling KoDP "in-depth" doesn't begin to do it justice; although it's fully text-based, every action you take has incredible consequences on what happens to your society.</p>

    <p>The ultimate chill-out game. As a single-celled organism, your goal is typically to avoid organisms larger than you, which will envelop you whole, and enveloping organisms smaller than you, enabling you to grow larger.</p>

    <p>This is a slow, almost meditative game that's perfect for sitting in bed on a lazy afternoon. Be sure to wear headphones to get the brunt of the game's full psychedelic audio-visual experience.</p>

    <p>Papa Sangre is a game with no visual component: you must navigate the game world using binaural sound to sense your surroundings. A horror game that has you traversing the Land of the Dead to retrieve a loved one, Papa Sangre is one of the most unique gaming experiences you'll ever have.</p>

    <p>Put on a pair of headphones, turn the lights off, and prepare for a treat. If you finish it and are dying for more, it also has a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/papa-sangre-ii/id710535349?mt=8&uo=4">sequel</a>.</p>

    <p>No, this isn't a video game tie-in to the <a href="http://www.theroommovie.com">classic cult film</a> of the same name. It's a clever puzzle game that's one of the best examples of how to use multitouch in ways that flat-out wouldn't work with traditional controls.</p>

    <p>The two Room games (there's a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-room-two/id667362389?mt=8&uo=4">sequel</a>) have a fantastic otherworldly air of mystery that reminds me a lot of Myst: something eerie is clearly going on in the world the designers have created, but the mystery never fully reveals itself.</p>

The iOS remakes embrace this, though: characters look like paper cutouts, being pushed around on-screen. Although the magic system is a bit frustrating, the rest of the game is great, from the multitude of branching paths to the enjoyable genre camp to the sheer production quality.</p>

    <p>They've currently released <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sorcery!-2/id627880433?mt=8&uo=4">one sequel</a>, with more to come; each new game lets you continue with your previously-developed character.</p>

Although you manipulate your chemical elements using a simple visual interface, conceptually the game manages to effortlessly evoke what it feels like to be a programmer. It's insanely hard at times, but unbelievably rewarding when you suceed.</p>

    <p>There's a desktop version of Spaceteam as well, but I preferred the direct manipulation of the touch-screen version.</p>

I love it for its hypnotic visuals and sound, perfectly-responsive controls, and sheer ball-busting difficulty. It's insanely difficult, but never cheap; when you lose, you feel it was your own fault. If you've ever played <a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>, it's by the same guy.</p>

    <p>As a hint: although great on an iPhone, it's a lot easier on an iPad.

Rather than being story-driven, like a traditional adventure game, Tiny Thief is divided up into levels; each level is a self-contained puzzle where you need to steal a given item and get out without getting caught.</p>

    <p>The earlier levels are a bit too easy, but don't let the cutesy aesthetic fool you: there's great classic adventure gaming to be had here.</p>

    <p>The definitive version of one of the best puzzle games of recent memory. Each turn, you are given a game piece to place on the board; place three of the same kind in a row, and they'll combine into a single upgraded piece. Three adjacent tufts of grass become one bush; three adjacent bushes in turn become one tree; it's turtles all the way down until you're building elaborate castles.</p>

    <p>You'll quickly reach a point where you never want to play Triple Town again, but reaching that point is a wonderful and unbelievably enjoyable journey.</p>

    <p>A fantastic turn-based strategy game. There's not anything particularly ground-breaking about its design, but the execution is spot-on. The balance between teams is great, there's a lot of depth in strategy if you're looking for it, and the presentation is pitch-perfect.</p>

    <p>A genius game by Loren Brichter (aka "the guy who invented pull-to-refresh"). It's ostensibly a "word game", but it's really a territory control game that just happens to use a Boggle-esque word finding mechanic. An absolute must-play, even if you're just playing against strangers.</p>

    <p>Strategery is essentially an abstract version of Risk. The game board is randomized, and there are a wealth of customizable settings, so it's very difficult to get bored with the game's strategic depth. There are many ways to play: online, local multiplayer, or single-player game against any number of AI opponents, with skill levels ranging from very beginner-friendly to blisteringly hard.</p>

    <p>It's Scrabble, on your phone. You've probably heard of it, but if you haven't, check it out. The board, point values, and letter distributions are tweaked from Scrabble to make games more exciting and higher-scoring, which was a very strong design choice.</p>

    Artemis is a "Starship Bridge Simulator". In other words, it's essentially a computer-aided Star Trek LARP, where your team has to work together in different roles on your ship (helmsman, engineer, weapons, etc) to go on various missions.</p>

    <p>Getting a full game of Artemis running requires more than just an iOS device (you need 4-5 friends using either PCs or iOS devices, and ideally a large TV connected to a PC to serve as the main display), but it's worth the effort for the unique experience.</p>

    <p>In this madcap game, each player is assigned a color. When brightly-colored squares begin to show up on-screen; you want to tap the most squares of your color. The end result is complete pandemonium; while you may fear for the safety of your iPad, it's ultimately a lot of fun.

    <p>I'm grouping these two games together because of how similar they are. Fingle is a two-player game that requires intense collaboration and finger coordination to solve puzzles. Finger Tied is very similar — although it doesn't explicitly require a second player, you'd be foolish to not treat it as if it were a multiplayer game.</p>

    <p>I'd check out Fingle first, as its explicit 2-player design means it's a little bit better for playing with a friend. Finger Tied has the benefit of a level editor, an online community to download new levels, and the potential for 3- and 4-player puzzling.</p>

    <p>OLO is a two-player game that's a lot like shuffleboard or crokinole with added strategic depth. You and your opponent take turns flicking pucks across the screen; while it doesn't sound that engrossing when described like that, it's an absolute blast.</p>

    <p>The physics feel as effortlessly natural as playing a physical game, and the mechanics are a lot deeper than the game first lets on.</p>

    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spaceteam/id570510529?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a92.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/8c/b9/3b/8cb93b7c-7f1e-376b-4666-626246fc9a15/mzl.kuxvahnw.jpg"/>
    <p>Spaceteam is, when all is said and done, a game about shouting at your friends. I honestly think Spaceteam is the single best game on any mobile platform. It encourages social interaction in a meaningful way, and it takes advantage of the form factor of a smartphone better than pretty much any other game out there. Above all, it's a heck of a lot of fun both to play and to watch.</p>

    <p>If you haven't played Spaceteam yet, get some friends together ASAP. It's free, although if you're like me you'll instantly purchase every optional in-app purchase the game has to offer to support the developer.</p>

<h1>iOS Games Worth Playing</h1>
<h3>Last updated on <strong>October 14, 2016</strong>.</h3>
<hr>
  <p>Every so often, a friend asks me for iOS game recommendations. I scramble around to see what I currently have installed on my phone, and invariably end up neglecting to mention one of my favorite games. This has been happening more and more often lately, which made me realize I should be writing my thoughts down instead of trying to remember them every time.</p>

  <p>I thus give you my definitive list of iOS games that are worth playing.</p>

  <h3 class='rules'>A few ground rules:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>I've aggressively pruned this list. If a game is on here, it's because I really liked it. Like, <em>really</em> liked it.</li>

    <li>This is subjective. If you're outraged your favorite game isn't included here, <a href="mailto:iosgames@lazerwalker.com">email</a> me or <a href="https://twitter.com/lazerwalker">tweet</a> at me. It's very possible I haven't played it and would love to hear about it!</li>

    <li>Although there are a lot of great iOS games that have been ported from other platforms, I'm not including ports unless I feel the iOS version is truly the definitive version.</li>

    <li>A few are singled out as being for the iPad. Some of these are in fact iPad-only; others are technically universal, but I think you'd be silly to play them on a phone.</li>

    <li>Some of these games cost money. Each game on this list will provide many hours of entertainment, usually for less than a cup of coffee. Most are self-published by small, independent studios. Don't be a cheapskate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Single-Player Games</h2>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/80-days/id892812659">80 Days</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/80-days/id892812659"><img class='icon' src="http://a286.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/61/a1/b6/61a1b6db-5eee-4211-867f-e6b96d9917ed/mzl.mifohjao.png"/></a>
    <p>80 Days is an interactive fiction adaptation of the classic Jules Verne novel "Around the World in Eighty Days", but don't think that means it's a cheap cash-in on a public domain property; it's got the highest production values I've ever seen for a text-based game.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/868-hack/id635749911?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">868-HACK</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/868-hack/id635749911?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a1763.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/bb/8f/b8/bb8fb888-3426-34f7-f0fe-07ccafa66613/mzl.twplhqtl.png"/></a>
    <p>"Elegant" doesn't begin to describe 868-HACK. Every single move you take makes the difference between winning and losing, so the stakes are always sky-high.</p>

    <p>It's a roguelike - a game with randomly-generated levels, brutal difficulty, and perma-death - making it fairly unapproachable and difficult to learn, but it's worth your time. There's a good reason that many well-respected game designers considered 868-HACK their favorite game of 2013.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/banner-saga/id911006986
">Banner Saga</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/banner-saga/id911006986
"><img class='icon' src="http://a414.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/e1/b5/51/e1b55192-b976-6bd9-8462-c2569994d18a/pr_source.png?downloadKey=1413349397_51b4427ff5898ac68ee65bf344c52e07"/></a>
    <p>When the creators of Banner Saga use the word "saga", they mean it in the literal sense. Banner Saga weaves an epic Norse tale on par with the Lord of the Rings in scope and grandeur, but with the added benefit of making you feel like you have meaningful control over the path the story takes.</p>

    <p>Gameplay itself is one part tactical RPG and one part choose-your-own-adventure. The battle system leaves a lot to be desired, but the two parts complement each other perfectly to create one of the most enjoyably atmospheric games I've ever played.
    <p>Banner Saga was originally released for PC, but the game suits the iPad form factor like a glove. It's the perfect title for curling up in bed or a comfy chair with a warm drink.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackbar/id672002602">Blackbar</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackbar/id672002602"><img class='icon' src="http://a1557.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/81/bc/f3/81bcf36f-4021-99ed-e65a-e9fa5e198a98/mzl.ikqexhro.png"/></a>
    <p>Set in a vague dystopian future, Blackbar tells the story of a resistance movement fighting back against censorship. The story itself is told through written letters which have themselves been censored; the game is in figuring out what the censored words are in each correspondance. </p>

    <p>Blackbar strikes the perfect balance between narrative and gameplay, with neither ever feeling too overbearing. It's short, sweet, and with just the right amount of political commentary.</p>
  </div>

<div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/blood-laurels/id882505676">Blood & Laurels</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/blood-laurels/id882505676"><img class='icon' src="http://a1019.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d9/0b/06/d90b069d-c7b8-e200-0531-654a360239e5/mzl.lzsmsboo.png"/></a>
    <p>Despite being "merely" text-based interactive fiction, Blood and Laurels feels like one of the most technically impressive games I've ever played. Set up as a pulpy political intrigue in ancient Rome, Blood & Laurels uses an incredibly sophisticated AI system to model the distinct and subtle relationships between its characters.</p>

    <p>The result is something that feels like taking part in an interactive play. I've never played a single-player game that manages to as successfully build a core game mechanic out of realistic-feeling human interactions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corrypt/id588935336?mt=8&uo=4">Corrypt</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corrypt/id588935336?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://a346.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/04/57/0e/04570e13-f1aa-35c0-b694-ce0671bd0e3e/mzl.pcdcjlnh.png"/></a>
    <p>Corrypt is one of my favorite games of all time. It starts out as a Sokoban-style block puzzle game, but things take a turn as the rules of the game start to collapse in on themselves.</p>

    <p>You'll have moments where you're convinced you've gotten the game into an unwinnable state and need to start over (hint: you're wrong). You'll have moments where a light bulb goes off and you're suddenly solving puzzles on a higher plane of thought. By the time the game is finished, you'll have had an incredibly personal and moving experience. I can't give Corrypt enough praise.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/device-6/id680366065">Device 6</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/device-6/id680366065"><img class='icon' src="http://a548.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/aa/9e/5e/aa9e5e1a-f2ef-5151-cd00-de6f1697f380/mzl.kwmwqgox.png"/></a>
    <p>An adventure game that's equal parts Alice in Wonderland and The Prisoner. Even though it's largely text-based, it takes advantage of the iOS form factor better than most games. Some of the puzzles are a bit obtuse.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dream-quest/id870227884">Dream Quest</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dream-quest/id870227884"><img class='icon' src="http://a53.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/f2/57/ac/f257ac8c-4ac8-de8c-cabe-92e85fc3fee5/mzl.zhmnpzli.png"/></a>
    <p>Combining many popular trends, Dream Quest is a roguelike deck-building game. If you can look past its embarassingly-amateurish graphics, you'll find a game with stunning levels of depth and brutal levels of difficulty. Many notable game designers have publicly stated their love for this game, including <em>Magic: the Gathering</em> creator Richard Garfield.</p>

    <p>If you download Dream Quest, be sure to also check out the <a href="http://www.pockettactics.com/features/winning-ugly-still-winning-peter-whalens-guide-dream-quest/">strategy guide</a> written by the creator.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dungeon-raid/id403090531">Dungeon Raid</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dungeon-raid/id403090531"><img class='icon' src="http://a244.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/e4/54/31/mzl.ubyhpedm.png"/></a>
    <p>Dungeon Raid was one of the earliest examples of the iOS trend of layering roguelike mechanics on top of an existing genre. In this match-3 puzzle game, each individual move affects your character.</p>

    <p>It layers on a solid puzzle core with a deep combo mechanic and a clever system for unlocks to create a fantastically addictive experience.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ftl-faster-than-light/id833951143">Faster Than Light</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ftl-faster-than-light/id833951143"><img class='icon' src="http://a154.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/76/5d/db/765ddb36-a47e-12a3-dcbe-09d7c2a3f1f9/mzl.fcrqvmhg.png"/></a>
    <p>FTL is a truly fantastic space-themed roguelike. Pilot a ship through the depths of space, micromanaging each of your crew members as you combat enemy ship after enemy ship.</p>

    <p>Since playing the PC version years ago I've wanted there to be an iOS version. The iPad version doesn't disappoint; ordering around your crew members with your finger goes a long way towards making you feel like an armchair space captain.</p>
  </div>


  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-firm/id883108531">The Firm</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-firm/id883108531"><img class='icon' src="http://a1008.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/cc/f4/1a/ccf41a5e-345f-a512-f628-97e113fc6c09/mzl.zdnzxjkg.png"/></a>
    <p>A small casual game that wraps Tinder-like "swipe left/right" mechanics around the theme of being a stock trader. It does a great job of slowly giving you more and more to do until you have to mentally manage dozens of different game rules, combining twitch impulses with mental acrobatics in a really fun way.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hearthstone-heroes-warcraft/id625257520">Hearthstone</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hearthstone-heroes-warcraft/id625257520"><img class='icon' src="http://a1285.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/8a/8e/d4/8a8ed418-e543-3cc2-c65f-7393bed7fac2/mzl.jwceymhs.png"/></a>
    <p>Blizzard's deck-building card game. If you've played Magic: The Gathering, you'll feel right at home. The iPad version is incredibly well-polished; its touch interactions feel more natural to me than the PC version.</p>

    <p>Despite being F2P it's very easy to enjoy the game without paying a cent. </p>

    <p>It's worth noting that Hearthstone requires an Internet connection to play, even if you're playing against AI opponents.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/helsings-fire/id380290526">Helsing's Fire</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/helsings-fire/id380290526"><img class='icon' src="http://a272.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/0e/8f/7b/mzi.sxroktjf.png"/></a>
    <p>Helsing's Fire is a unique puzzle game combining a novel lighting/shadow mechanic (you must place a limited number of light sources to illuminate multiple targets) with a slick Victorian-horror aesthetic.</p>

    <p>It hasn't been updated for 4-inch screens, but it's worth playing even with letterboxing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hoplite/id782438457?mt=8&uo=4">Hoplite</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hoplite/id782438457?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://a213.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/2a/f2/c4/2af2c42b-c870-46bc-c3e6-a544cdf34b76/mzl.daxifsbm.png"/></a>
    <p>Hoplite is a pared-down hex-based turn-based strategy game with roguelike mechanics layered on top. It's chess-like in the way that simple movement patterns elegantly combine to form higher-level strategies.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hundreds/id493536432?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Hundreds</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hundreds/id493536432?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a65.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c1/42/59/c1425921-3637-92c0-7112-28c63ed370c3/mzl.nddrfchp.png"/></a>
    <p>Hundreds is the perfect combination of reflex-based gameplay and strategy: although the game demands precise finger dexterity, you can deliberate as long as you want before acting.</p>

    <p>Hundreds also works really well as a collaborative multiplayer game - get some friends and gather around your iPad!</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/king-of-dragon-pass/id335545504?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">King of Dragon Pass</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/king-of-dragon-pass/id335545504?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a1257.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c7/e9/d4/c7e9d403-31bd-feb6-a0bf-74ecb7d73271/mzl.lqxbxdxg.png"/></a>
    <p>In this civilization sim, you're in charge of a primitive tribe in a fantasy world. Every action you take has severe consequences on what happens next; the sheer depth of the text-based simulation is impressive.</p>
    </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monument-valley/id728293409">Monument Valley</a></h3>

    <p>A gorgeous Escher-inspired puzzle game. It's one of those games that isn't particularly challenging, but the act of playing it is an immensely serene and enjoyable experience.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osmos/id382991304?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Osmos</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osmos/id382991304?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a1429.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/f8/44/8a/f8448a14-8cbe-b400-64ad-d06076ec0e12/mzl.fquallzc.png"/></a>
    <p>The ultimate chill-out game. As a single-celled organism, your goal is typically to avoid organisms larger than you, which will envelop you whole, and enveloping organisms smaller than you, enabling you to grow larger.</p>

    <p>This is a slow, meditative game that's perfect for sitting in bed on a lazy afternoon. Be sure to wear headphones for the full experience.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/papa-sangre/id407536885?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Papa Sangre</a></h3>

    <p>A horror game that has you traversing the Land of the Dead, what makes Papa Sangre unique is that it has no visual component. You navigate the game world using binaural sound to sense your surroundings. </p>

    <p>Put on a pair of headphones, turn the lights off, and prepare for a treat. If you finish it and are dying for more, it also has a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/papa-sangre-ii/id710535349?mt=8&uo=4">sequel</a>.</p>

    <p>No, this isn't a tie-in to the <a href="http://www.theroommovie.com">classic cult film</a> of the same name. It's a clever puzzle game that's a great example of how to use multitouch to create an experience that flat-out wouldn't work with traditional controls.</p>

    <p>The two Room games (there's a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-room-two/id667362389?mt=8&uo=4">sequel</a>) also have a fantastic otherworldly air of mystery that evokes Myst: there's clearly something eerie going on in the game's world, but the mystery never fully reveals itself.</p>

    <p>A minimalist take on tower defense and real-time strategy games. Both the visuals and the mechanics themselves have been pared down to the bare minimum to create a stunning experience.</p>
  </div>

    <p>Fans of games like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem will find themselves right at home with this turn-based strategy wargame. Perfect touch controls, great strategic depth, and a narrative that oozes personality.</p></div>

Although the magic system is frustrating, the rest is great, from the campy paper cut-out art to the many branching paths.</p>

    <p>They've currently released <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sorcery!-2/id627880433?mt=8&uo=4">one sequel</a>, with more to come; each new game lets you continue with your previously-developed character.</p>

It manages to capture the conceptual essence of programming at its best. It's insanely hard at times, but equally rewarding.</p>

    <p>There's a desktop version as well, but dragging around molecules with your finger is a natural fit for the iPad.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game'>

    <p>Strategery is essentially an abstract version of Risk. Between a randomized game board and a wealth of customizable settings, it's very difficult to get bored with Strategery.</p>

    <p>If you're playing solo the AI has difficulty levels randing from beginner-friendly to blisteringly hard; the game also offers both online (asynchronous) and local multiplayer.</p>

I love it for its hypnotic visuals and sound, perfectly-responsive controls, and sheer ball-busting difficulty. It's insanely difficult, but never cheap.

    <p>As a hint: although great on an iPhone, it's a lot easier on an iPad.

Rather than being story-driven, Tiny Thief is divided up into self-contained puzzles, making it great for short play sessions.</p>

    <p>The earlier levels are a bit too easy, but don't let the cutesy aesthetic fool you: there's great classic adventure gaming to be had here.</p>

    <p>The epitome of "simple to learn, difficult to master" puzzle games. Triple Town is essentially a match-3 puzzler, but joining three like pieces together causes them to combine into a single upgraded piece.</p>

    Artemis is a "Starship Bridge Simulator". In other words, it's essentially a computer-aided Star Trek LARP, where your team has to work together in different roles on your ship (helmsman, engineer, weapons, etc).</p>

    <p>Getting a full game of Artemis running requires more than just an iOS device (you need 4-5 friends using either PCs or iOS devices, and ideally a large TV connected to a PC to serve as the main display), but it's worth the effort for the unique experience.</p>

    <p>A game of complete madness requiring everyone to madly tap on your iPad screen at the same time. This is pretty similar to Chicanery, which I enjoy a bit more, but Bloop is still worth your time.</p>

    <p>Each player must hold an on-screen button. If you let go of your button, you lose. You can do whatever you want to get your opponents to move their fingers off the screen, preferably without serious bodily harm.</p>

    <p>The end result is a game that feels a lot like an iPad version of <a href="http://brutallyunfairtactics.com">B.U.T.T.O.N.</a> in the way that it encourages real-world physical play within a digital system.</p>

    <p>These two games are very similar, so I'm grouping them together. They both task you with solving puzzles by moving your fingers around the screen, inevitably getting them tangled up in the process.</p>

    <p>I'd check out Fingle first, as its explicit 2-player design means it's a little bit better for playing with a friend. Finger Tied has the benefit of a level editor, an online community to download new levels, and the potential for 3- and 4-player puzzling.</p>

    <p>A 2-player head-to-head tank-battle game. Each time you use an action, its control is randomly replaced with another one. Add in other mechanics that complicate things, and it's easy to get overwhelmed in a good way.

    <p>A tip: on the main menu, tap and hold on the tank image to enable "glitch mode", which will cause your game to be affected by a random glitch that changes the gameplay.</p>

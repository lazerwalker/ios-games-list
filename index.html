<h1>iOS Games Worth Playing</h1>
<h3>Last updated on <strong>October 28, 2015</strong>.</h3>
<hr>
  <p>Every so often, a friend asks me for iOS game recommendations. I scramble around to see what I currently have installed on my phone, and invariably end up neglecting to mention one of my favorite games. This has been happening more and more often, which made me realize I should be writing my thoughts down.</p>

  <p>I thus give you the definitive list of iOS games that I think are worth playing.</p>

  <h3 class='rules'>A few ground rules:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>I've aggressively pruned this list. If a game is on here, it's because I <em>really</em> liked it.</li>

    <li>This is subjective. Your favorite game's not here? <a href="mailto:iosgames@lazerwalker.com">Email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/lazerwalker">tweet</a> at me! It's very possible I haven't played it and would love to hear about it.</li>

    <li>I've only included included ports where I feel the iOS version is truly the best one.</li>

    <li>A few are singled out as being for iPad. Some of these are iPad-only, others are merely far better on a tablet than a phone.</li>

    <li>Some of these games cost money. Each game on this list will provide many hours of entertainment, usually for less than a cup of coffee. Most are self-published by small, independent studios. Don't be a cheapskate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class='rules'>Changelog</h3>

    <h3><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/altos-adventure/id950812012?mt=8&uo=4'>Alto's Adventure</a></h3>
    <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/altos-adventure/id950812012?mt=8&uo=4'><img class='icon' src='http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/2f/5f/d3/2f5fd3b0-b25a-78f5-9612-08f0cfe82b09/source/100x100bb.jpg'/></a>
    <p>One of those game worlds that's a pleasure to merely inhabit. As an infinite runner, it's okay; as an experience trying to capture the beauty of snowboarding through pristine wilderness, it's incomparable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game story words' id='80-days'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/80-days/id892812659">80 Days</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/80-days/id892812659"><img class='icon' src="http://a286.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/61/a1/b6/61a1b6db-5eee-4211-867f-e6b96d9917ed/mzl.mifohjao.png"/></a>
    <p>An interactive fiction adaptation of "Around the World in Eighty Days", but that's selling it short. Phenomentally crafted, and so expansive and freeform it's possible to have multiple playthroughs without reading the same thing twice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game puzzle' id='868-hack'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/868-hack/id635749911?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">868-HACK</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/868-hack/id635749911?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a1763.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/bb/8f/b8/bb8fb888-3426-34f7-f0fe-07ccafa66613/mzl.twplhqtl.png"/></a>
    <p>The most elegant roguelike I've ever played. Every single move you take is the difference between winning and losing; the stakes are always sky-high. It's unapproachable and unwelcoming, but well worth your time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game story strategy' id='banner-saga'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/banner-saga/id911006986
">Banner Saga</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/banner-saga/id911006986
"><img class='icon' src="http://a414.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/e1/b5/51/e1b55192-b976-6bd9-8462-c2569994d18a/pr_source.png?downloadKey=1413349397_51b4427ff5898ac68ee65bf344c52e07"/></a>
    <p>This truly is a "saga" in the literal sense. One part tactical RPG, one part choice-based interactive fiction, it strikes an interesting balance. It's available for PC, but feels like it was meant for the iPad.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='game puzzle story words' id='blackbar'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackbar/id672002602">Blackbar</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackbar/id672002602"><img class='icon' src="http://a1557.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/81/bc/f3/81bcf36f-4021-99ed-e65a-e9fa5e198a98/mzl.ikqexhro.png"/></a>
    <p>Set in a vague dystopian future, Blackbar tells the story of a resistance movement fighting censorship, by means of solving censorship puzzles. It's short, sweet, and strikes the right balance of story and puzzle.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game strategy' id='brogue'>
    <h3><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brogue/id613921309?mt=8&uo=4'>Brogue</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brogue/id613921309?mt=8&uo=4'><img class='icon' src='http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/17/30/f2/1730f2f2-73de-7466-06c8-42ed2f86df9c/source/100x100bb.jpg'/></a>
    <p>A classic Roguelike known for its relatively gentle difficulty curve and beautiful ASCII graphics. Brogue's official iPad port is the only traditional desktop roguelike I've seen really work on iOS without an external keyboard.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game puzzle' id='corrypt'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corrypt/id588935336?mt=8&uo=4">Corrypt</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corrypt/id588935336?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://a346.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/04/57/0e/04570e13-f1aa-35c0-b694-ce0671bd0e3e/mzl.pcdcjlnh.png"/></a>
    <p>A Sokoban-style block puzzle whose rules quickly start to collapse in on themselves. I've never played a puzzle game that so successfully managed to convey meaning through pure mechanics. Sheer brilliance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game action' id='desert-golfing'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desert-golfing/id902062673">Desert Golfing</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desert-golfing/id902062673"><img class='icon' src="http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Purple3/v4/3b/1c/26/3b1c2681-667c-1cc0-0242-d1c8cfa00b12/mzl.pwuazpbe.jpg"/></a>
    <p>A punk-y minimalist distillation of Angry Birds-style controls into a golf game. You'll find no achievements or leaderboards or fancy graphics here, just a focused, distilled, addictive version of golf that seems to go on forever.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game story puzzle words' id='device-6'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/device-6/id680366065">Device 6</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/device-6/id680366065"><img class='icon' src="http://a548.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/aa/9e/5e/aa9e5e1a-f2ef-5151-cd00-de6f1697f380/mzl.kwmwqgox.png"/></a>
    <p>An adventure game that's equal parts Alice in Wonderland and The Prisoner. Even though it's largely text-based, it takes advantage of the iOS form factor better than most games. Some of the puzzles are a bit obtuse.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game action' id='downwell'>
    <h3><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downwell/id1032708262?mt=8&uo=4'>Downwell</a></h3>
    <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downwell/id1032708262?mt=8&uo=4'><img class='icon' src='http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/1e/ed/5b/1eed5ba7-e79d-1316-1210-f503eb4c107c/pr_source.png/0x0ss-85.jpg'/></a>
    <p>Downwell is a minimalist roguelike platformer about descending a well, armed only with a pair of trusty gunboots. Comparisons are often drawn to the masterpiece <strong>Spelunky</strong>, and they're not undeserved. Easily the best action game I've played on iOS.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game strategy' id='dream-quest'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dream-quest/id870227884">Dream Quest</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dream-quest/id870227884"><img class='icon' src="http://a53.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/f2/57/ac/f257ac8c-4ac8-de8c-cabe-92e85fc3fee5/mzl.zhmnpzli.png"/></a>
    <p>Dream Quest is a roguelike deck-building game. If you can look past its embarassingly-amateurish graphics, you'll find a game with stunning depth and brutal difficulty. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.pockettactics.com/features/winning-ugly-still-winning-peter-whalens-guide-dream-quest/">strategy guide</a> written by the creator.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game puzzle' id='drop7'>
    <h3><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drop7/id425242132?mt=8&uo=4'>Drop7</a></h3>
    <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drop7/id425242132?mt=8&uo=4'><img class='icon' src='http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Purple3/v4/56/4e/aa/564eaadf-f023-5ab7-42f4-abbbd72c5ba8/mzl.guwoznya.png'/></a>
    <p>An iOS classic, Drop 7 is an addictive numbers-based puzzle game that feels like it's existed forever.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game puzzle' id='dungeon-raid'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dungeon-raid/id403090531">Dungeon Raid</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dungeon-raid/id403090531"><img class='icon' src="http://a244.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/e4/54/31/mzl.ubyhpedm.png"/></a>
    <p>Dungeon Raid was one of the earliest examples of the iOS trend of layering roguelike mechanics on top of a Match-3 game. A deep levelling system, a cool combo mechanic, and a clever system for unlocks give it longevity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game puzzle' id='english-country-tune'>
    <h3><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/english-country-tune/id476962614?mt=8&uo=4'>English Country Tune</a></h3>
    <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/english-country-tune/id476962614?mt=8&uo=4'><img class='icon' src='http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Purple/c1/87/ce/mzl.gewnrnxr.png'/></a>
    <p>A puzzle game that seems fairly straight forward at first, if a bit tricky, it eventually folds in on itself in a series of mind-blowingly fantastic moments. One of the most interesting puzzle games you'll ever play.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game strategy' id='faster-than-light'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ftl-faster-than-light/id833951143">Faster Than Light</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ftl-faster-than-light/id833951143"><img class='icon' src="http://a154.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/76/5d/db/765ddb36-a47e-12a3-dcbe-09d7c2a3f1f9/mzl.fcrqvmhg.png"/></a>
    <p>FTL is a truly fantastic space-themed roguelike. Pilot a ship through the depths of space, micromanaging each of your crew members as you combat enemy ship after enemy ship. Originally built for PC, but it works far better on iPad. </p>
  </div>


  <div class='game puzzle action' id='the-firm'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-firm/id883108531">The Firm</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-firm/id883108531"><img class='icon' src="http://a1008.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/cc/f4/1a/ccf41a5e-345f-a512-f628-97e113fc6c09/mzl.zdnzxjkg.png"/></a>
    <p>A small game wrapping a stock trading theme around a Tinder-like swipe interaction. It does a great job of slowly giving you more to do until you're managing dozens of different rules in your head under time pressure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game puzzle story' id='her-story'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/her-story/id952658953">Her Story</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/her-story/id952658953"><img class='icon' src="http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Purple1/v4/f9/50/21/f950219d-90d5-a804-077c-459d6284ffbe/mzl.ngujptgp.png"/></a>
    <p>A phenomenal FMV game where you explore the circumstances surrounding a murder by searching and viewing old police interview footage. I don't want to give anything away; if you're at all interested in narrative games, Her Story is more than worth playing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game strategy' id='hearthstone'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hearthstone-heroes-warcraft/id625257520">Hearthstone</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hearthstone-heroes-warcraft/id625257520"><img class='icon' src="http://a1285.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/8a/8e/d4/8a8ed418-e543-3cc2-c65f-7393bed7fac2/mzl.jwceymhs.png"/></a>
    <p>Blizzard's F2P deck-building card game. It's heavily inspired by Magic, but far simpler to grasp. A great example of doing F2P right, and a fantastic iOS port. It needs an Internet connection to play, even just against the AI.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game action' id='helix'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/helix/id562550427?mt=8&uo=4">Helix</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/helix/id562550427?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Purple1/v4/e8/d9/0e/e8d90e57-5b70-f9f8-4563-afeeb76a2aa2/mzl.zdxguwgi.png"/></a>
    <p>A fantastic twitchy action game by Michael Brough. Its touch controls – you're trying to draw loops around enemies to kill them – works effortly in ways that most games don't.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game puzzle' id='helsings-fire'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/helsings-fire/id380290526">Helsing's Fire</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/helsings-fire/id380290526"><img class='icon' src="http://a272.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/0e/8f/7b/mzi.sxroktjf.png"/></a>
    <p>A unique puzzle game combining a pretty cool lighting/shadow mechanic with a slick Victorian-horror aesthetic. It hasn't been updated for 4-inch screens, but it's worth playing even with letterboxing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game puzzle strategy' id='hoplite'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hoplite/id782438457?mt=8&uo=4">Hoplite</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hoplite/id782438457?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://a213.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/2a/f2/c4/2af2c42b-c870-46bc-c3e6-a544cdf34b76/mzl.daxifsbm.png"/></a>
    <p>A pared-down hex-based turn-based strategy game with roguelike mechanics layered on top. It's chess-like in the way that simple movement patterns elegantly combine to form higher-level strategies.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game action puzzle' id='hundreds'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hundreds/id493536432?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Hundreds</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hundreds/id493536432?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a65.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/c1/42/59/c1425921-3637-92c0-7112-28c63ed370c3/mzl.nddrfchp.png"/></a>
    <p>The perfect combination of reflex-based gameplay and strategy: although the game demands precise finger dexterity, you can deliberate a long time before acting. It also works great as a collaborative multiplayer game on iPad!</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game action' id='kero-blaster'>
    <h3><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keroblaster/id867598817?mt=8&uo=4'>Kero Blaster</a></h3>
    <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keroblaster/id867598817?mt=8&uo=4'><img class='icon' src='http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Purple6/v4/db/02/ee/db02eed9-98b6-319f-4025-0153f2ce76c2/mzl.hfsdxlzp.png'/></a>
    <p>By Daisuke Amaya (of "Cave Story" fame), Kero Blaster is a jump-and-gun platformer with fantastic touch-based controls. It's also completely adorable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game strategy story words' id='king-of-dragon-pass'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/king-of-dragon-pass/id335545504?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">King of Dragon Pass</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/king-of-dragon-pass/id335545504?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a1257.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/c7/e9/d4/c7e9d403-31bd-feb6-a0bf-74ecb7d73271/mzl.lqxbxdxg.png"/></a>
    <p>In this civilization sim, you're in charge of a primitive tribe in a fantasy world. Every action you take has severe consequences on what happens next; the sheer depth of the text-based simulation is impressive.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game atmosphere puzzle' id='lara-croft-go'>
    <h3><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lara-croft-go/id971304016?mt=8&uo=4'>Lara Croft GO</a></h3>
    <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lara-croft-go/id971304016?mt=8&uo=4'><img class='icon' src='http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/9c/c8/e4/9cc8e43c-b52f-6d5c-1ac7-5ef8220e6845/source/100x100bb.jpg'/></a>
    <p>A clever turn-based puzzle game based on the Tomb Raider series. Wonderful puzzle design, and an absolutely lovely aesthetic.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game story action puzzle' id='lili'>
    <h3><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lili/id560692867?mt=8&uo=4'>Lili</a></h3>

    <p>A quirky RPG/adventure game that has you climbing on the backs of mystical spirits to collect flowers. There are some F2P mechanics, which is frustrating for a paid game, but it's otherwise absolutely charming.</p>
  </div>

    <p>It's Scrabble, on your phone. You've probably heard of it, but if you haven't, check it out. The board, point values, and letter distributions are tweaked from Scrabble to make games more exciting and higher-scoring.</p>

    <p>(Full disclosure: I used to work on the Facebook version of WWF.)</p>

    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/artemis-spaceship-bridge-simulator/id578372500?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Artemis</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/artemis-spaceship-bridge-simulator/id578372500?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a1271.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/2f/76/f7/2f76f7ba-5a09-910f-0504-bf02263d2295/mzl.vbkngult.png"/></a>
    Artemis is basically a computer-aided Star Trek LARP. Your team of 4-5 players, each with their own device and distinct role, need to work together as a crew to steer the ship and accomplish various missions. Totally nerdy, and totally great.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game action' id='bloop'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bloop-tabletop-finger-frenzy/id517320341?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Bloop</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bloop-tabletop-finger-frenzy/id517320341?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a74.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/36/40/dd/3640ddeb-4487-fc42-5f5f-413439078476/mzl.kozjohvf.png"/></a>
    <p>A game of complete madness requiring everyone to madly tap on your iPad screen at the same time. This is pretty similar to Chicanery, which I enjoy a bit more, but Bloop is still worth your time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game atmosphere' id='bounden'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bounden/id850456491">Bounden</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bounden/id850456491?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Purple3/v4/e9/ed/d1/e9edd1bd-87a6-a0da-e7f4-ec6d73d99bfc/mzl.tvnluwkr.png"/></a>
    <p>An absolutely beautiful collaborative dancing game. Two players, holding the same phone, will have to contort themselves in ways that create a wonderful abstract modern dance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game action' id='chicanery'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chicanery/id395775628?mt=8&uo=4">Chicanery</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chicanery/id395775628?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://a1935.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/d8/67/36/mzi.juadbsfa.png"/></a>
    <p>Each player must hold an on-screen button. If you let go of your button, you lose. You can do whatever you want to get your opponents to move their fingers off the screen (although preferably without any serious bodily harm).</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game puzzle' id='fingle'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fingle/id490109661?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Fingle</a> / <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finger-tied/id533011708?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Finger Tied</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fingle/id490109661?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a1632.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple2/v4/df/9d/ed/df9dedff-2771-28b6-8f59-4fa70567ff82/mzl.gqkkvnsv.png"/></a>
    <p>These two games are very similar, so I'm grouping them together. They both task you with solving puzzles by moving your fingers around the screen, inevitably getting them tangled up in the process.</p>
  </div>

    <div class='game action strategy' id='glitch-tank'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-tank/id490257878?mt=8&uo=4">Glitch Tank</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glitch-tank/id490257878?mt=8&uo=4"><img class='icon' src="http://a734.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/f1/6f/55/f16f550f-cea8-c261-063c-a834c67e563d/mzm.kbyjckpa.png"/></a>
    <p>A 2-player head-to-head tank-battle game. Each time you use an action, its control is randomly replaced with another one. Add in other mechanics that complicate things, and it's easy to get overwhelmed in a good way.
  </div>

  <div class='game action strategy' id='olo'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/olo-game/id529826126?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">OLO</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/olo-game/id529826126?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a91.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/de/c6/68/dec66894-b793-3bba-c87b-05db3ef98c27/mzl.cykkqigv.png"/></a>
    <p>OLO is a 2-player game similar to shuffleboard or crokinole. You and your opponent take turns flicking pucks across the screen. The physics feel as effortlessly natural as playing a physical game.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game action' id='recurse'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/recurse/id524371030?mt=8">Recurse</a> (iPad)</h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/recurse/id524371030?mt=8"><img class='icon' src="http://a1108.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/86/89/33/8689333f-1c4a-14b8-28bd-c1ba361f9507/mzl.yuzgfjqm.png"/></a>
    <p>Recurse is an iPad game that feels like it belongs on the Kinect. It uses the front-facing camera to use your body as input, tasking you with challenges that essentially force you to look silly in front of your friends.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='game action strategy' id='spaceteam'>
    <h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spaceteam/id570510529?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Spaceteam</a></h3>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spaceteam/id570510529?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"><img class='icon' src="http://a92.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/8c/b9/3b/8cb93b7c-7f1e-376b-4666-626246fc9a15/mzl.kuxvahnw.jpg"/></a>
    <p>Spaceteam is ultimately a game about shouting at your friends. It's an absolutely phenomenal party game for gamers and non-gamers alike. It also happens to be free.</p>
